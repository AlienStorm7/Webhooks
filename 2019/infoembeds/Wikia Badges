      "description": "In addition to being active on the Discord, users are also able to gain XP by completing certain tasks on the [My Hero Academia Wiki](http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/Special:SignUp). When a specific task is completed you will automatically be awarded an achievement badge. There are three levels of rarity for completing tasks: bronze, silver, and gold. Each one with a specific set amount of XP rewarded. \n** **\nXP can be claimed retroactively by users who have already made an account and have contributed to the wiki. If you don't already have a wiki account making one will reward you 50 XP. Any questions regarding how to do a task on the wiki should be asked in #jobboard or #productive work.",
